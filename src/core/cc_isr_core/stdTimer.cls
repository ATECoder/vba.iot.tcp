'Module greatly inspired by Cristian Buse's SafeTimers:
'  https://github.com/cristianbuse/Excel-VBA-SafeTimers
'
'Inspirations used:
'  * Use of remote workbook
'  * Use of VBOM and simplified registry setting
'
'Comparison of SaveTimers-Native and stdTimer:
'  * stdTimer will not raise the Tick event while displaying MsgBox or InputBox, however SafeTimers will
'  * stdTimer will raise events while Edit mode is "Edit" or "Point", SafeTimers-Native do not.
'  * stdTimer uses COM events (specifically WorksheetChange), SafeTimers-Native uses direct COM calls as a communication mechanism
'  * stdTimer can be bound to stdICallable callback OR via event interop. SafeTimers-Native can only be hooked into with Module macro names
'
'Limitations:
'  * Neither set of timers raise events while debugging code.
'  * Neither set of timers will be called exactly when it needs to. There will be a little bit of error which may have to be corrected.
'
'Architecture:
'  When a timer is initialized it:
'    * Ensures VBOM is enabled
'    * Creates a `new Application` object and adds a workbook to this new application.
'    * Adds Timer code to this workbook and schedules this code to run with `xlApp.OnTime Now(), "MainLoop"`
'  Every time the timer loops
'    * A change to the remote workbook's worksheet is made
'    * In the original workbook we register to receive these events, and receive a `xlRemoteWorkbook_SheetChange` event.
'    * Here we raise the event, and call the callback if supplied.
'  When this class is terminated
'    * It will also tell the remote workbook to close.
